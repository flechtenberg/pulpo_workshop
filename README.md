## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup

To get started with the workshop, follow these steps to set up your environment.

### 1. Download the Repository
- Clone or download the repository and store the files in a folder named `pulpo_workshop`.

### 2. Create a Conda Environment
- Ensure you are using **Python 3.10** for this workshop, as **Python 3.11 or later is (currently) not supported**.
  
  **Command to create a conda environment**:
  ```bash
  conda create --name pulpo_brightcon_env python=3.10
  conda activate pulpo_brightcon_env
  ```

### 3. Install PULPO
- Once the environment is set up, install the PULPO package by running the following command:
  
  ```bash
  pip install pulpo-dev
  ```

### 4. Install Additional Dependencies for Notebook X2
- Notebook `X2_PULPO_exercise.ipynb` requires additional dependencies. Install them by running the following commands:
  
  ```bash
  pip install python-louvain
  pip install networkx
  conda install conda-forge::ipopt=3.11.1
  ```

### 5. Install Additional Dependencies for Notebook X0
- Notebook `X0_optimization.ipynb` requires additional dependencies. Install them by running the following commands:
```bash
pip install ipywidgets ipywidgets
pip install pdf2image
pip install ipympl
```
